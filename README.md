# Programming Handled Systems

Fundamental principles and concepts that underlie the programming of handheld systems, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and tablet computers. Particular emphasis will be placed on concepts such as limited display size, power, memory and CPU speed; and new input modalities, where handheld systems differ substantially from non-handheld systems, and thus require special programming tools and approaches. Students will apply these concepts and principles in the context of an existing handset programming platform.
